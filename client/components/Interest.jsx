          Not only am I a Software Engineer, I am also a World Class Martial
          Artist. I have studied Wushu Kung Fu since the age of five. I have won
          numerous World Titles as well as performed in front of legends such as
          having the honor of performing in front of the living cast of Bruce
          Leeâ€™s Enter the Dragon for their 40th reunion. I studied many Wushu
          weapons as well as study Martial Arts Tricking.
